# Restaurant Reservation APP version 2

Updating my previous reservation app from 2021. This application allows guests
to make, view, update and/or cancel dining reservations for a fictional
restauraunt "Rick's Cafe"

The app has four main features

1.  User may fill out application with name, phone number, date and time of
    reservation, and so forth. Data is stored in a mySQL database.
2.  After form submission, user can review the submitted data and review for
    accuracy.
3.  User may choose to edit the submitted data.
4.  User can cancel a submitted reservation.

While the first version was written in procedural JavaScript, the updated
version is being written in Object Oriented JS. Additionally, it is making use
of Bootstrap 5.0.

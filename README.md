# Restaurant Reservation APP version 2
Updating my previous reservation app from 2021. This application allows guests to make, view, update and/or cancel dining reservations for a fictional restauraunt "Rick's Cafe"

The app has four main features

1.  User may fill out application with name, phone number, date and time of reservation, and so forth. 
Data is stored in a mySQL database.
2.  After form submission, user can review the submitted data and review for accuracy.
3. User may choose to edit the submitted data.
4. User can cancel a submitted reservation.

The updated application will rely heavily on ES6 syntax and conventions on the client side and PDO on the server side.
